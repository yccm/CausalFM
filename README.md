# CausalFM

PyTorch Implementation on Paper [Foundation Models for Causal Inference via Prior-Data Fitted Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10914)

## Introduction

In this paper, we introduce **CausalFM**, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings.


CausalFM provides a **unified framework** for training foundation models across multiple causal inference tasks, including:  

- **Standard CATE estimation**  
- **Instrumental Variables (IV) learning**  
- **Front-door adjustment**  

This repository contains dataset generation pipelines, model implementations, and training/evaluation scripts.
